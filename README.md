# multiwii-rocket

Builds on the MultiWii v2.4 base for extra functionality, bugfixes and rocket engineering.

# Based on MultiWii 2.4

The source is based on the final release of [MultiWii v2.4 from Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/multiwii/) which is SVN based. The [Change](docs/change.txt) and [Credits](docs/CREDITS.txt) files have been moved to the `docs` folder.

We're also using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) instead of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) to build and deploy the solution.
